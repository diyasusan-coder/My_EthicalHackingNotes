✅ Overview of Hacking
Hacking involves unauthorized access to computer systems or data.

Ethical Hacking is the authorized practice of testing systems for vulnerabilities to prevent malicious attacks.

✅ Common Types of Cyber Attacks
1. Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack
The attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.

Purpose: To steal information (e.g., passwords) or manipulate messages.

Example: Eavesdropping on users via unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.

2. Zero-Day Attack
Targets unknown software or hardware vulnerabilities.

Key Point: The vulnerability is exploited before the developer is aware—giving them zero days to address the flaw.

✅ Ethical Hacking Team Roles
Red Team

Simulates real cyberattacks to evaluate an organization’s security.

Blue Team

Focuses on defense.

Monitors systems, detects threats, and responds to attacks.

Purple Team

Acts as a bridge between Red and Blue Teams.

Enhances collaboration and strengthens overall cybersecurity posture.

✅ Popular Ethical Hacking Platform
Kali Linux:
A widely-used Linux distribution equipped with numerous tools for penetration testing and ethical hacking practice.
