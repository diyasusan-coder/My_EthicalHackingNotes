🔍 1. Understanding Hacking
Hacking: Unauthorized access to computer systems or data.

Ethical Hacking: Authorized testing of systems to identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them.

🚨 2. Types of Cyber Attacks
🔸 1. Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack
Intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge.

Purpose: Eavesdrop, steal credentials, or modify communication.

Example: Capturing data on unsecured public Wi-Fi.

🔸 2. Zero-Day Attack
Exploits unknown vulnerabilities before developers are aware.

Impact: No time to patch; highly dangerous.

🔸 3. Phishing
Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy source.

Methods: Email, SMS, fake websites.

Goal: Steal login credentials, credit card info, etc.

🔸 4. Ransomware
Malware that encrypts a user’s data and demands payment (ransom) to restore access.

Impact: Disrupts businesses, risks data loss.

🔸 5. Malware
Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to systems.

Types include: Viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and adware.

🔸 6. Social Engineering
Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information.

Techniques: Impersonation, pretexting, baiting, or scare tactics.

Focus: Exploits human psychology rather than technical flaws.

🛡️ 3. Ethical Hacking Roles
🔴 Red Team
Offensive security experts.

Simulate real-world attacks to expose system vulnerabilities.

🔵 Blue Team
Defensive team.

Monitors, detects, and defends against cyber threats.

🟣 Purple Team
Collaboration between Red and Blue Teams.

Enhances coordination for stronger security posture.

🧪 4. Platforms for Ethical Hacking Practice
Kali Linux: A widely used Linux distribution equipped with a suite of penetration testing and cybersecurity tools.
